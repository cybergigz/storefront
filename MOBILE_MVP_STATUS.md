- [x] Built product listing screen with:
  - Grid layout (2 columns)
  - Product images
  - Product names
  - Prices
  - Loading states
  - Error handling
  - Tap to view details
- [x] Built product detail screen with:
  - Product images
  - Product name and description
  - Price display
  - Variants list
  - Add to Cart button (UI only)
- [x] Built cart screen with:
  - Empty state UI
  - Cart items display (placeholder)
  - Total price display
  - Checkout button (UI only)
- [x] Updated tab navigation icons and labels

## üì¶ Files Created/Modified

### New Files Created:

1. `/mobile/lib/graphql.ts` - URQL client configuration
2. `/mobile/lib/queries.ts` - GraphQL queries
3. `/mobile/.env.example` - Environment variable template
4. `/mobile/app/product/[id].tsx` - Product detail screen
5. `/mobile/README.md` - Mobile app documentation
6. `/MOBILE_MVP_STATUS.md` - This file

### Modified Files:

1. `/mobile/tsconfig.json` - Fixed TypeScript configuration
2. `/mobile/app/_layout.tsx` - Added URQL Provider
3. `/mobile/app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` - Updated tab labels and icons
4. `/mobile/app/(tabs)/index.tsx` - Product listing screen
5. `/mobile/app/(tabs)/two.tsx` - Cart screen
6. `/mobile/components/ExternalLink.tsx` - Removed unnecessary ts-expect-error
7. `/mobile/package.json` - Added urql and graphql dependencies

## üéØ What Works Now

1. **TypeScript**: Compiles without errors
2. **Dev Server**: `pnpm mobile:dev` starts Expo successfully
3. **Navigation**: Tab navigation and screen routing work
4. **GraphQL Client**: URQL client configured and integrated
5. **Product Listing**: Shows products from Saleor API (when configured)
6. **Product Details**: Navigate from list to detail view
7. **Empty Cart**: Cart screen shows empty state

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Required

To use the app with a Saleor instance:

1. Create `/mobile/.env` file:

```env
EXPO_PUBLIC_SALEOR_API_URL=https://your-saleor-instance.saleor.cloud/graphql/
```

2. Update channel name if needed in:
   - `mobile/app/(tabs)/index.tsx` (line 6)
   - `mobile/app/product/[id].tsx` (line 8)

## üöÄ How to Test

1. **Install dependencies** (if not already done):

```bash
pnpm install
```

2. **Start dev server**:

```bash
pnpm mobile:dev
```

3. **Test on simulator/device**:

   - Press `i` for iOS simulator
   - Press `a` for Android emulator
   - Scan QR code with Expo Go on physical device

4. **Test features**:
   - View product list (requires valid Saleor API URL)
   - Tap product to view details
   - Navigate to Cart tab (shows empty state)

## üîú Next Steps (Future Work)

### Phase 1: Complete Cart Functionality

- Add Zustand store for cart state
- Implement "Add to Cart" functionality
- Show cart items in cart screen
- Calculate cart totals

### Phase 2: User Authentication

- Integrate @saleor/auth-sdk
- Add login screen
- Add user account tab
- Implement token management

### Phase 3: Checkout Flow

- Create checkout screens
- Add shipping address form
- Add payment integration (Stripe/Adyen)
- Order confirmation screen

### Phase 4: Additional Features

- Search functionality
- Categories/Collections screens
- Product filters
- Order history
- User profile

### Phase 5: Shared Package Migration

- Move GraphQL operations to packages/shared
- Move checkout logic to shared
- Share business logic between web and mobile

## üìä Implementation Progress

**Current Status**: ~30% complete for testable MVP

- ‚úÖ Infrastructure: 100%
- ‚úÖ Basic UI screens: 100%
- ‚úÖ GraphQL integration: 100%
- ‚è≥ Cart functionality: 20% (UI only)
- ‚ùå Authentication: 0%
- ‚ùå Checkout: 0%

**What Can Be Tested Now**:

- Mobile app launches successfully
- TypeScript compiles without errors
- Navigation between screens works
- GraphQL queries can fetch products (with valid API URL)
- UI looks good and is responsive

**What Cannot Be Tested Yet**:

- Adding products to cart
- Checkout process
- User login/registration
- Making actual purchases

## üí° Notes

- The app is now in a **testable state** for UI/UX review
- GraphQL integration is complete but requires Saleor API configuration
- Cart and checkout are placeholder UIs that need backend integration
- TypeScript configuration is fixed and stable
- All dependencies are installed and working

## üêõ Known Issues

1. Cart functionality is placeholder only (no state management yet)
2. "Add to Cart" button does nothing (needs implementation)
3. Channel name is hardcoded (should be configurable)
4. No error recovery for network failures
5. No offline mode or caching strategy

## üìù Commit Recommendation

Suggested commit message:

```
feat: Implement mobile MVP with product listing and detail screens

Option 3 Complete:
- Fix TypeScript configuration (remove expo/tsconfig.base dependency)
- Verify mobile app builds and runs successfully
- Add comprehensive README documentation

Option 2 Complete:
- Add URQL GraphQL client integration
- Create product listing screen with grid layout
- Create product detail screen with navigation
- Add cart screen with empty state
- Update tab navigation (Products + Cart)
- Add environment configuration support

The mobile app now displays products from Saleor API and provides
basic navigation. Cart and checkout are placeholder UIs ready for
future implementation.

Ready for testing with: pnpm mobile:dev
